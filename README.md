# PWA Deployment
Modifying an App that was already written to add compression, PWA support, and deploy to Heroku.

## Getting Started
This application runs in node.js, using Mongoose to update a MongoDB database, Express as a server, and is deployed on Heroku.

I contributed PWA capabilities, deployed on Heroku, and set up the MongoDB on Heroku.
